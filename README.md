## Weekly App
The "Weekly" app is a 7-day todo list. 
With "Weekly", you can keep track of task completion throughout the entire week.
The tasks are stored locally on your web browser.
The website is currently optimized to be viewed on desktop.

### Features
- Add/Delete tasks
- Edit task description
- Mark task complete/incomplete
- Add title describing week (like "Week of November 23-29, 2025")
- Clear all tasks for a particular day
- Clear all tasks for entire week

## Goals
Have tasks you want to complete, but have not really set on what day you will complete it? Use Goals. 
Goals works like a traditional to-do list. 
Just type the name of the task, then add it to the list. 
Once you're finished, you can remove it. 
Made a typo in your task entry? No worries, you can edit it.
