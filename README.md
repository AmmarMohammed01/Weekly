## Weekly App
The "Weekly" app is a 7-day todo list. <br>

The tasks are stored locally on your web browser. <br>
The website is currently optimized to be viewed on desktop. <br>

### Features
- Add/Delete tasks
- Edit task description
- Mark task complete/incomplete
- Add title describing week (like "Week of November 23-29, 2025")
- Clear all tasks for a particular day
- Clear all tasks for entire week

## Goals
Have tasks you want to complete, but have not really set on what day you will complete it? Use Goals. <br>
Goals works like a traditional to-do list. <br>
Just type the name of the task, then add it to the list. <br>
Once you're finished, you can remove it. <br>
Made a typo in your task entry? No worries, you can edit it.
